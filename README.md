# Logan
A digital planner designed for college students, to help you keep track of your assignments and various commitments. Not a completed project, I'm still actively working on developing this, but it is functional and I use it myself every day. I also have a handful of friends beta testing the app via TestFlight. 

Makes use of CloudKit to store data, force touch, and two Today extensions. Syncs with a corresponding desktop application for macOS.

I started this project because I have used a digital planner to keep track of my schoolwork for years, but never found one that felt particularly intuitive. I wanted to make a planner that organized things in the same way that I thought about them in my head.
